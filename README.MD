# MSSQL
Test Connectivity to MSSQL DB using docker
Using MSSQL docker container, knex and a dummy database.

Mac users can use Azure Data Studio to open and interact with the DB using a GUI. 

This repo is only inteded to connect to a database and performa a simple query. 

I also have a docker-comppose that will start the dummy MSSQL container and load some tables.
